/** This class is a Source implementation for Cassandra Connector related Codahale metrics. It is
  * automatically instantiated and registered by Spark metrics system if this source is specified in
  * metrics configuration file.
  *
  * Spark instantiates this class when `SparkEnv` is started. There can be only a single instance of
  * `SparkEnv` so there can be at most a single active instance of `CassandraConnectorSource`.
  * The active instance is assigned to [[CassandraConnectorSource._instance]] so that it can be retrieved
  * from anywhere by [[CassandraConnectorSource.instance]] method. We need this because we have to access
  * the meters from the task execution.
